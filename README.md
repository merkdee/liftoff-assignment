## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be an Pro Football Draft Evaluator that will allow fanatics to view potential rookies their favorite Pro football team should draft based on performance metrics(categories) by offense, and defense. Users may create an account but will need one in order to like, comment, or share in addition to setting a hometeam by default. 

I decided to make this project because I love watching college football and then seeing those players get drafted and play on sunday. While there are obviously high profile colleigate players they we know they'll do great on the pro level. We often dont think where. So come draft night, as a fan we become blind-sided when our favorite team draft some unknown kid, when a high-profile player was left on the board. Most of the time, we find out its related to a gap team weakness. Or the current team strengths doesnt compensate for the team weakness. This application will give fans perspective on what NFL front office are look for after self evaluating.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am still to Bootstrap and CSS. I understand HTTP Requests, HTTP Responses, and serving up templates. I don't know how to serve a report, or if if should just design the layout of the 'report' in the template since I just want to display my data through graphs. I was able to create my own dataset and I will have to do some research on whether or not I want to implement the one I built(in python) or pay for service. I good thing is my datasets are in CSV format and Java will be doing the reporting. I also will have to figure out if I can have all of this in just one DB, reusing templates within templates.
